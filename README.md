# CoonsPatch
A basic implementation of Coon's Patch in Blender using Blender scripting.

## Introduction
A Coons patch is a mathematical construct employed in computer graphics to create a continuous transition between surfaces, as well as in finite element method and boundary element method in computational mechanics to create meshed elements for problem domains.

## Implementation
The coon's patch is constructed by reading co-ordinates from the text file "coons_patch_points". Each four lines in the file contains the control points of a Bezier curve. For each curve each two lines contains one endpoint of the bezier curve and itâ€™s adjacent control point respectively. These four sets of control points determine the boundary of your Coons patch.

## Results
The results of the coon's patch generated are as follows:
